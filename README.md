# Brain Analysis - A Machine Learning Approach

This notebook describes a Machine Learning approach to extract the relashionship between a independent variable x and an independent variable y.

Our dataset contains information about the human brain, such as brain weight and head size.

Using the **Linear Regression** method, our model can predict the brain weight knowing the head size.


Library: **scikit-learn**

Error Metrics: **R square**, **RMSE**

Plotting library: **Matplotlib**
